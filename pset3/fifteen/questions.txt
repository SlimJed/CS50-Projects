0. 3x3,4x3,5x3,3x4,5x4,6x4,3x5,4x5,5x5,6x5,3x6,4x6,5x6,6x6,

1. The game board is represented with a Multi Dimensional Array.

2. The greet(); function is called to greet the player at game start.

3. The functions {
    void init(void);
    void draw(void);
    bool move(int tile);
    bool won(void); 
    } Need to be implemented by me.
